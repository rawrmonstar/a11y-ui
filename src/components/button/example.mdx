# Alert

> A button is a widget that enables users to trigger an action or event, such as
> submitting a form, opening a dialog, canceling an action, or performing a
> delete operation
—[WAI-ARIA-Practices-1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#button)

> Please just use a real `<button>` 🙏
—Tegan Churchill

## Basic Usage

<Playground>
  <Button onClick={() => alert("💁‍ I'm a button in <span>'s clothing")}>
    {({ getProps }) => (
      <span {...getProps()}>What am I? 🤔</span>
    )}
  </Button>
</Playground>

## Props

### children
`function({})` | *required*

This is the only **required** prop. `children` is our render prop and must be a
function. It is called with an object argument:

| **property**      | **type** | **description** |
|-------------------|----------|-----------------|
| `getProps` | function(props: object) | returns the props for the button element(e.g., a span) |

### onClick
`function(event)`

Although not technically required, it's a good idea for a button do something
when it's clicked. Add the click handler to the `<Button>` so the handler is
called on the spacebar and enter presses, just like a real `<button>`!
