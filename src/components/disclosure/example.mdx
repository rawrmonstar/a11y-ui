# Disclosure

> A disclosure is a button that controls visibility of a section of content
â€”[WAI-ARIA-Practices-1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#disclosure)

## Basic Usage

<Playground>
  <Disclosure>
    {({ getControlProps, getContentProps, isExpanded }) => (
      <React.Fragment>
        <button {...getControlProps()}>
          {isExpanded ? "Collapse content ðŸ™ˆ" : "Show content ðŸ‘€"}
        </button>
        <p {...getContentProps()} hidden={!isExpanded}>
          Here is your content ðŸ˜Ž
        </p>
      </React.Fragment>
    )}
  </Disclosure>
</Playground>

## Props

**children** *function* required

This is the only **required** prop. `children` is our render prop and must be a
function. It is called with an object argument:

- `getControlProps` - returns the props to be applied to the control element 
  (e.g., a button)
- `getContentProps` - returns the props to be applied to the content element
- `isExpanded` - the current state of the disclosure

**isExpanded** *boolean*

If you want the disclosure to be controlled, you can pass in a boolean to 
`isExpanded` and the component will honor the prop's value.

**onChange** *function*

Called whenever the component attempts a state change. If the component is
is controlled (i.e., you are managing `isExpanded`), you should update 
`isExpanded` based on this handler
