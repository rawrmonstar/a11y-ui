# Alert

> An alert is an element that displays a brief, important message in a way that
> attracts the user's attention without interrupting the user's task
â€”[WAI-ARIA-Practices-1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#alert)

## Basic Usage

This is a very simple component and applies `role="alert"` to whatever element
you decide to spread props on.

<Playground>
  <Alert>
    {({ getProps }) => (
      <div {...getProps()}>
        <p>ðŸš¨ Here is some important info for you ðŸ“£</p>
      </div>
    )}
  </Alert>
</Playground>

## Props

### children
`function({})` | *required*

This is the only **required** prop. `children` is our render prop and must be a
function. It is called with an object argument:

| **property**      | **type** | **description** |
|-------------------|----------|-----------------|
| `getProps` | function(props: object) | returns the props for the alert element (e.g., a div) |
