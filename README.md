The goal of this project is to create accessible render props components
for a large number of design patterns and widgets. Focus will be on implementing
widgets described in
[wai-aria-practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#aria_ex),
but more widgets will be added. The idea is that these render props components
can be used as the foundation of your own component library and be confident
that your components have a good baseline of accessibility.
